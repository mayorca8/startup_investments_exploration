## Overview

The Startup Investments Exploration project is an exploratory data science project that explores and analyzes the given data set, formulates hypotheses, and provides insights.



## The Data Set
This data set has startup investment data, capturing detailed information around the company funding rounds, their status, and post-IPO (initial public offering) figures - if applicable. The data set includes, but is not limited to, categorizations by market/industry, country and state (if US based). 

The data appears to come from Crunchbase and was retreived from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/arindam235/startup-investments-crunchbase). The data set may be downloaded from this repo, but is also accesible on Kaggle's website. A user account may be required to access the data on their site. 

As of 7/16/2020, the data set has 54,294 rows and 39 columns.
